## Entrez Molecular Sequence Database System (Entrez)

Entrez is a molecular biology database system that provides integrated access to nucleotide and protein sequence data, genomic mapping informaiton, 3D structure data, PubMed MEDLINE, and more. This system is produced by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). 

Entrez is NCBI's primary text search and retreival system that integrates the PubMed database of biomedical literature with 38 other literature and molecular databases

The web based search interface for these NCBI databases is avaiable to the public [here, through the U.S. National Library of Medicine](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/).
